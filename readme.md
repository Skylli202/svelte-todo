# Svelte Todo

The idea of this repository was to practice navigator JavaScipt with DOM manipulation within Svelte. As well as core concept of Svelte like : Stores, Reactivity, Binding and much more.

Based upon an original idea of [Grafikart](https://grafikart.fr/), [Pratiquons avec une TodoList](https://grafikart.fr/tutoriels/javascript-todolist-2074#autoplay)
